# 🚍 BUZZ — Smart Campus Bus Tracker

A real-time bus tracking app built for Universities. Students can view bus routes, track buses live on a map, and receive admin announcements. Drivers share their live GPS location. Admins manage buses, drivers, stops, and broadcast announcements — all from a password-protected panel.
